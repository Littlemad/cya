He was known in the streets to not be disturbed by any cutpurse when he was walking around the city, especially when on business. Even so he was feeling that today something was off, and the mantra was helping him to keep busy that part of the brain that was telling him to watch his own shadow, so he could think about the whole situation.",
			"longDesc2": "He was not followed, and neither was following anyone other than his lonely thoughts. It was just another sunday morning returning from his last job trying to tire himself before returning to his apartment and sleeping. The job was too easy but his instinct and adrenaline had kicked in anyway and sleeping was a long hours away from him. Physical exercise was what usually helped him to calm and expunge the extra energy.",
			"longDesc3": "Even so his nose must have picked something because he quickly realised that a scent that wasn't part of these alleys was slowly intensifying in the air.",

A smell of a exotic spice, of a distant desert, sweat of overburdened slaves, of a thousand years old immutable place, of death and submission, of luxurious imperative desire and of powerful and intricate dark magic.",
			"longDesc2": "At the end of the corridor a red mist of what seems like sand appears from nowhere, and a small controlled gust of wind moves it in a spinning manner creating a vortex where at the end of it a different light appears where a shadow figure of a man stand waits for you to approach this unusual corridor.",
			"longDesc3": "The red mist vortex gets stronger and stronger occupying slowly the whole alley, the wind doesn’t seem affecting anything else, but you cover your nose and mouth quickly to avoid inhaling any of that substance while you walk slowly in a straight line towards the mysterious figure figure taking your time and assessing the situation.",

			"longDesc2": "You wait for quite a while, the scent never disappears or intensifies, you keep vigilant, and still wait some more. Then all of the sudden your sword starts to become rusty. No sound, no one living in the alleys, no wind either. Just rust that should appear in the span of years is quickly spreading from the tip of your sword towards the base of the hilt at alarming speed.",

			"longDesc3": "You drop the sword on the ground instantly before the rust touches your hands, and you hear the clang of the sword on the ground while it literally shatters at the impact. You slap hard yourself to try to snap out of it, but you confirm that it is not an illusion. It is magic, some kind of magic that you have never seen. ",
